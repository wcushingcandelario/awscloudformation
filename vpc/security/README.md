# Cloudformation
## AWS Security Group Templates
The templates in this directory are children of the VPC templates.  They rely on `outputs` from those templates.  These Cloudformation templates will provision the VPC with the security groups needed for the OVC Server, Promotion Engine, Inventory Manager and CSL products.
